# Amazing Clothes
## About the Project
Amazing Clothes is a social media and recommendation platform for parents where they can review kid's clothing, get informed recommendations and share their shopping experiences with a vast community.

## Tech
React Native | JavaScript | Firebase

## Application Features
- Fashionable parents have the phenomenon of conformity and chasing           fashion clothes for their kids. In our app, users can upload pictures (videos) of products they are interested in, and follow the trend of the fashion product based on the likes or dislikes of other users for purchase reference. 
- Amazing Clothes brings you a new way to create and discover fancy clothes from all over the world. You can watch, like, comment and share clothes in a dedicated space.

## Application Innovations
- Both manufacturers and consumers are potential users of the app. Considering the information gap between brands and fans, the APP will set up a special operation section for brand users.
- By reducing poor information, brands can produce effectively, reduce unsalable products, and reduce the cost of trial and error for fans, which is green and environmentally friendly.
- Users can easily know the trendy clothes.
